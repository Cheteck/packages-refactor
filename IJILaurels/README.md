# IJILaurels - Gamification & Reputation System for IJIDeals Platform

**Package Name (Tentative):** `ijideals/ijilaurels`

## Vision

`IJILaurels` is envisioned as a comprehensive Laravel package to introduce gamification elements, such as badges, points, and reputation scores, across the IJIDeals suite of packages (including `UserManagement`, `IJICommerce`, and the future `IJICommerce-ProductCollaboration` module).

The goal is to enhance user engagement, incentivize positive contributions, and provide a framework for recognizing user achievements and status within the platform.

## Key Planned Features (Conceptual)

1.  **Badge Management:**
    *   System for defining various badges (e.g., "Top Contributor," "Early Adopter," "First Sale," "Verified Seller").
    *   Criteria for awarding badges (manual assignment by admins, or automatic based on specific events/thresholds).
    *   Visual representation for badges.
    *   Ability for users to display earned badges on their profiles.

2.  **Points System:**
    *   Framework for awarding points to users for specific actions (e.g., completing a profile, making a purchase, selling an item, successfully proposing a product edit, receiving positive reviews).
    *   Configurable point values for different actions.
    *   User point balances.
    *   Potential for points to be redeemable or contribute to levels/status.

3.  **Reputation Score / Levels:**
    *   Algorithm or system to calculate a reputation score or assign user levels based on activity, points, badge completion, longevity, community feedback, etc.
    *   Visual indicators of reputation/level.

4.  **Event-Driven Architecture:**
    *   Listeners for various platform events (e.g., `UserRegistered`, `OrderCompleted`, `ProductProposalApproved`, `ReviewSubmitted`) that can trigger badge/point awards.
    *   Extensible to allow new events from other packages to feed into the gamification engine.

5.  **Leaderboards:**
    *   Optional feature to display leaderboards based on points, badges, or specific achievements.

6.  **Admin Interface:**
    *   Tools for platform administrators to define badges, manage award criteria, manually award/revoke badges or points, and view user gamification statistics.

7.  **Integration & Extensibility:**
    *   Designed to be easily integrated with other IJIDeals packages.
    *   Provide clear APIs or events for other packages to interact with (e.g., "award X points for Y action").

## Dependencies

*   Likely to depend on `ijideals/usermanagement` for user context.
*   Will be designed to integrate with events and models from `ijideals/ijicommerce` and `ijideals/ijicommerce-product-collaboration`.

## Status

This `README.md` serves as an initial placeholder to capture the vision for the `IJILaurels` package. Development will be planned and undertaken as a separate project, likely after core functionalities of `IJICommerce` are well-established.
