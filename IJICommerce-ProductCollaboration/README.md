# IJICommerce - Product Collaboration Module (Future Extension)

**Package Name (Tentative):** `ijideals/ijicommerce-product-collaboration`

## Vision

This package is envisioned as an extension to the core `ijideals/ijicommerce` package. Its purpose is to introduce advanced, collaborative, and community-driven features for the management and enrichment of the `MasterProduct` catalog within the IJICommerce ecosystem.

While the core `IJICommerce` package will establish platform administrators as the primary curators of `MasterProduct` data (once a product is live), this Product Collaboration module will provide mechanisms for trusted shop owners and the wider user community to contribute to the accuracy, detail, and overall quality of product information.

## Key Planned Features

1.  **Sole Seller Master Product Editing:**
    *   Allow a shop administrator (e.g., 'Owner' or 'Administrator' of their shop) to directly edit certain fields of a `MasterProduct` if their shop is currently the *only* shop selling that specific `MasterProduct`.
    *   Once other shops begin selling the same `MasterProduct`, this special editing privilege for the original shop would revert, and only platform administrators could edit the `MasterProduct`.
    *   Platform administrators would still retain ultimate override capability and may be notified of such edits.

2.  **Community-Proposed Edits to Existing Master Products:**
    *   Implement a system allowing authenticated users (or specifically, shop team members) to propose modifications to existing, active `MasterProduct` details.
    *   Proposals would be submitted for specific fields (e.g., suggesting a better description, correcting a specification, adding a missing attribute).
    *   These proposals would enter a moderation queue for platform administrators.
    *   Platform administrators can review, approve (partially or fully), or reject these proposed edits.
    *   If an edit proposal is approved and merged, it updates the canonical `MasterProduct` data. This would then trigger the notification and re-activation workflow for all shops currently selling that product (as defined in the core `IJICommerce` package).

3.  **Contribution Tracking & Potential Gamification/Rewards:**
    *   Track user and shop contributions to product data (e.g., number of approved proposals, significant edits).
    *   Lay the groundwork for a future system to potentially reward active and quality contributors (e.g., points, badges, reputation scores) to incentivize community engagement.

## Dependencies

*   This module will depend on the core `ijideals/ijicommerce` package and its `MasterProduct` and `ShopProduct` architecture.
*   It will also interact with the User model and the Spatie Permissions setup established by the core package and the consuming application.

## Status

This `README.md` serves as a placeholder to capture the vision for this future package/module. Development will commence after core functionalities of `IJICommerce` (including foundational product management) are stable.
